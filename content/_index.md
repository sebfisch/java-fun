# Functional Patterns in Java

> Conventional programming languages are growing *ever more enormous, but not stronger*.

In his Turing-Award lecture in 1978,
[John Backus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Backus) asked:
__Can programming be liberated from the von Neumann style?__
He gave a damning report on the state of programming at the time.

> *Inherent defects* at the most basic level cause them to be both *fat and weak*:
> their primitive word-at-a-time style of programming
> inherited from their common ancestorâ€”the von Neumann computer,
> their close coupling of semantics to state transitions,
> their division of programming into a world of expressions and a world of statements,
> their inability to effectively use powerful combining forms
> for building new programs from existing ones,
> and their lack of useful mathematical properties for reasoning about programs.

This assessment is 42 years old.
Today, functional programming languages focus on *expressions rather than statements*,
which enables them to provide *powerful combining forms* for programs
with *useful properties for reasoning*.
As a result, conventional programming languages are incorporating patterns
from functional programming.
Java is no exception.
