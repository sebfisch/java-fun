# Functional Patterns in Java

This repository contains the sources for the Tutorial:
[Functional Patterns in Java](https://sebfisch.github.io/java-fun/).

It references a [docker container](https://github.com/sebfisch/docker-wiki-dev)
that can be used to
write and generate the corresponding site.
You can start the development environment using

    # docker-compose run --rm --service-ports dev

On first use you should clone submodules as follows.

    # git submodule init && git submodule update

Inside the container, you can start the development server using

    # hugo server --bind 0.0.0.0

The site should then be available at localhost:1313.

You can use your global git config in the container as follows.

    # cp ~/.gitconfig .git/config

Your ssh keys are mounted into the container automatically.
If that does not work or you have permission issues
you may want to adjust corresponding settings in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
